## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jsjsjsia/cpp.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cpp
   ```
3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 -o main main.cpp
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./main
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the `main.cpp` file to explore the implemented algorithms.
2. Uncomment the desired algorithm function to see its output.
3. Modify the input values directly in the code to test different scenarios.
